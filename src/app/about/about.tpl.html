  <h1>Welcome to Web Dev and Design</h1>

  <p>
    This course is about making websites.  To that end, you'll be learning the technical stuff: <strong class="tag-HTML">HTML</strong>, <strong class="tag-CSS">CSS</strong>, and <strong class="tag-javascript">Javascript</strong>.  
    At the same time, we'll also discuss higher order, more conceptual stuff: elements of design, information architecture, 
    usability, and purpose.  Your work in the course will be centered around a series of projects, supported by readings and exercises to develop 
    technical skills and design thinking you'll need for those projects.  I think that the more this course can be focused on whatever 
    it is <strong>you really want to make</strong>, the better it will be.  
  </p>

<h2>Freedom &amp; Community</h2>
<p>
Learning HTML and CSS requires lots (and lots) of practice and experimentation, and so does design.  Thus, we'll be 
spending a lot of our class time in "lab time", in which you'll be free to work on exercises and projects, ask questions, 
and get informal feedback from me and each other.  What's obvious is that this lab is a shared space, and people are here to learn.   
What's maybe less obvious is that students are coming to this class with a wide range of experience and comfort
with computers, programming, and design.  There's an art to being a badass without being intimidating, and to helping 
someone solve a problem in a way that also helps them learn.  There's also an art to being a confident yet receptive novice. 
</p>


<h2>Your Code &amp; Other People’s Code</h2>
<p>
There is a lot of free code out there online.  You can learn a lot from reading other people’s code.  
It can show you techniques for solving problems, examples of how to use new tools, models of clear and 
elegant code.  (Of course, there’s also a lot of messy code out there, so beware.)  So, yes: we will be 
reading plenty of code from other people in here—from the textbook, from each other, from the Internet.   
</p>
<p>
But there’s a difference between reading other people’s code and using it.  Certainly, if you use someone’s 
code, you should cite it as a matter of intellectual honesty.  Early on, though, I would strongly advise even
 against doing that.  You are learning a new language here, and to get fluent, you have got to <em>type and type and
 type and type and type</em>.  So, two guidelines for the first month:
<ol>
  <li>Don’t copy and paste code.  Not even if you have permission.</li>
  <li>If you need to use an example as a reference, that is fine, but hide the window or book before you start typing.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Finally: occasionally, there will be times when I ask you not to refer to any outside sources.  I understand 
that this restriction is artificial, and that challenging assignments amidst heavy workloads can cause anxiety.  
If you are ever in such a bind that you think there’s no way out, talk to me.  I will help.
