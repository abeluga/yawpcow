  <h1>Welcome to Web Dev and Design</h1>

  <p>
    This course is about making websites.  To that end, you'll be learning the technical stuff: <strong class="tag-HTML">HTML</strong>, <strong class="tag-CSS">CSS</strong>, and <strong class="tag-javascript">Javascript</strong>.  
    At the same time, we'll also work on higher order, more conceptual stuff: elements of design, information architecture, 
    usability, and purpose.  Your work in the course will be centered around a series of projects, supported by readings and exercises to develop 
    technical skills and design thinking you'll need for those projects.  I think that the more this course can be focused on whatever 
    it is <strong>you really want to make</strong>, the better it will be.  
  </p>

<h2>Learning to Code</h2>
<p>
Learning to code can be pretty different from the stuff you're used to learning in school.  Here's some advice
I've gathered from past students (and myself) over the years.
<dl>
  <dt>Set up your environment.</dt>
  <dd>Coding almost always involves interacting with multiple files in multiple programs all at the same time.
    Invest some time in setting up your computer as an effective workspace.  And, from time to time, rearrange it
    to suit your increasingly complex needs.</dd>
  <dt>Experiment</dt>
  <dd>To code effectively, you've got to understand how the code works in practice, what it actually does.  Look at 
    examples, change stuff and see what happens, even make little examples for yourself.  Sure, coding is technical
    and conceptual, but it is also&mdash;maybe even more so&mdash;a <em>craft</em>.  You can't learn carpentry just 
    by studying the <em>idea</em> of a dovetail joint&mdash;you've got to try it.  The same goes for coding.</dd>
  <dt>Speed and Grammar: practice!</dt>
  <dd>This is a subject where speed and grammar are both going to matter quite a bit.  This is not some kind of silly,
    arbitrary measure of proficiency; it's a practical necessity.  It will be hard to make genuine
    progress making things without being fairly fluent at writing code; and because computers, unlike (most) humans, 
    are extremely unforgiving of grammatical mistakes.  The only answer I know to this: <em>type and type and type and type
    and type</em>.  Write lines upon lines of code&mdash;and write them <em>yourself</em>.  (Actually, here are two other
    tips: learn keyboard shortcuts, and format your code.)</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h2>Learning Design</h2>
<p>
This course is as much about <em>design thinking</em> as it is about coding.  Design principles certainly apply across
different media, but, of course, we'll be focusing on design in the context of making websites.  How?
<dl>
  <dt>Experiment</dt>
  <dd>As with coding, experimentation is at the heart of design.  Sometimes, you'll experiment specifically to understand how
    a certain bit of code works.  Other times, you'll experiment with different aesthetics or user interaction design ideas. 
    But ideally, you'll spend most of your time really playing with both at the same time.</dd>
  <dt>Iterate</dt>
  <dd>Ideas are cheap.  It's what you <em>do</em> with them.  Getting feedback and revising and then getting feedback and then
    revising and then getting feedback and then revising....  No need to belabor this point: critiques are an
    absolutely essential part of the design process, and participating in them from both sides is essential to developing 
    your design thinking and skills.</dd>
  <dt>Collect Inspriation</dt>
  <dd>Just as important as <em>making</em> stuff is <em>looking</em> at (and playing with) stuff.  Be a sponge, collect examples of design
    that you see&mdash;both on and <a href="http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/design/offline-inspiration/" title="Vandelay Design: Offline Inspiration">offline</a>&mdash;and then <a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/2008/08/21/dont-copy-a-design-steal-it/" title="use it well">use it responsibly</a>.  Also, start a list of designers whose work you admire; look at their work, read about their processes on their blogs, try to run into them in coffee shops, ....
  </dd>
</dl>

</p>

<h2>Freedom &amp; Community</h2>
<p>
We'll be spending a lot of our class time in "lab time", in which you'll be free to experiment, work on exercises and projects, 
ask questions, and get informal feedback from me and each other.  What's obvious is that this lab is a shared space, and people 
are here to learn.  What's maybe less obvious is that students are coming to this class with a wide range of experience and comfort
with computers, programming, and design.  There's an art to being a badass without being intimidating, and to helping 
someone solve a problem in a way that also helps him/her learn.  There's also an art to being a confident yet receptive novice. 
</p>


<h2>Your Code &amp; Other People’s Code</h2>
<p>
There is a lot of free code out there online.  You can learn a lot from reading other people’s code.  
It can show you techniques for solving problems, examples of how to use new tools, models of clear and 
elegant code.  (Of course, there’s also a lot of messy code out there, so beware.)  So, yes: we will be 
reading plenty of code from other people in here—from the textbook, from each other, from the Internet.   
</p>
<p>
But there’s a difference between reading other people’s code and using it.  Certainly, if you use someone’s 
code, you should <em>cite your source</em> as a matter of intellectual and artistic honesty. Early on, though, I would strongly advise even
against doing that: as mentioned above, you need practice actually typing lines of code yourself. So, for the first
month, <em>please don’t copy and paste code</em>&mdash;not even if you have permission.  Read other people's code to learn from it, 
but type your own. (The one exception to this is copying-and-pasting so that you can read the code in your own environment, 
and maybe tinker with it as you read.)
</p>
<p>
Finally: occasionally, there will be times when I ask you not to refer to any outside sources.  I understand 
that this restriction is artificial, and that challenging assignments amidst heavy workloads can cause anxiety.  
If you are ever in such a bind that you think there’s no way out, talk to me.  I will help.
</p>

<h2>What You Need</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Reliable access outside of class to a computer with:
  <ul>
    <li>Internet access</li>
    <li><a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a></li>
    <li>A code editor. We'll start with <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> for now, but once you've got some of the basics down, <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> are more good options with a bit more power.
